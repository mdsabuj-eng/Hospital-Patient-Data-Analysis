Final Summary Report: Hospital Patient Data Analysis
Objective:
The main objective of this project was to perform data cleaning, transformation, SQL querying, and visualization on hospital patient records to extract meaningful insights for management and operational decision-making.

Database Tables Used:
Patient_Info_Cleaned: Contains patient demographic and hospital stay information.

Treatment_Record_Cleaned: Contains treatment details for each patient.

Data Cleaning Summary:
Missing Values: Filled using median (numeric) and mode (categorical).

Duplicates: Removed from all tables.

Invalid Values: Negative or zero values (like invalid age) replaced with the median of valid values.

Inconsistent Categories: Categorical fields (like Gender, Name) cleaned (trimmed, case-fixed, unified categories like 'M'→'Male').

Data Types: Ensured correct types — integers for IDs, floats for continuous variables, strings for categorical data.

Key SQL Insights:
Average Stay Duration per Outcome:
Calculated the average number of hospital stay days based on patient outcomes such as 'Recovered', 'Deceased', etc.

(Skipped) Avg Treatment Duration per Department:
Skipped due to lack of joinable department-level information across tables.

Visualizations Created:
Bar Chart: Outcome-wise Patient Count
Showed the total number of unique patients under each outcome category.

(Skipped) Box Plot: Treatment Duration per Department
Skipped because department-level treatment duration analysis was not feasible due to data limitations.

Pie Chart: Distribution of Treatment Types
Displayed the percentage breakdown of various treatment types (e.g., Surgery, Therapy, Medication).

Line Chart: Admissions per Month (Optional)
Trend of patient admissions month-wise was visualized to understand seasonal or periodic patterns.

Final Insights & Recommendations:
The majority of patients fell under the "Recovered" outcome category.

'Medication' was the most frequent treatment type provided.

Patient admissions showed monthly variation — hospital management can use this for resource and staff planning.

Certain analyses (like Department-wise trends) could not be performed due to missing relational data — future data collection should ensure proper foreign key relationships (e.g., between Staff, Treatment, and Patient tables).

Project Completion Status:
Task Category	Status
Data Cleaning	Done
SQL Query 1	Done
SQL Query 2	Skipped (Data Limitation)
Visualization 1	Done
Visualization 2	Skipped (Data Limitation)
Visualization 3	Done
Visualization 4 (Optional)	Done
Final Summary Report	Done

Possible Future Improvements:
Collect Department-related keys in all tables to enable Department-level analysis.

Include Staff ID and Treatment Staff linkage to analyze Staff performance.

Add patient diagnosis data for deeper disease-wise insights.

Conclusion:
This project demonstrates end-to-end handling of a healthcare dataset — from database querying, cleaning, and transforming, to insightful visualizations — fulfilling the core tasks expected from an entry-level Data Analyst.
